To create a global configuration file containing default values, run the
command:

  cva-create gen_config

When this has completed, you will find a cva-create.json file in your home
directory.


To create a new project using this command, open a terminal window and navigate
to the folder where you want the project created and issue the following
command:

  cva-create app_dir app_id app_name [platform list]

The platform list is optional.  If you do not specify any platforms as
parameters, then cva-create will add the platforms listed in your local
configuration file.  If a local configuration file does not exist, then the
platforms listed in the global configuration file will be added.

So, if Android and iOS are listed as default platforms in your global
configuration file, then to create a project called Thingamajig in a folder
called thing_1 you would use the following command:

  cva-create thing_1 com.mycorp.thingamajig Thingamajig

To create the same project, but add in the Firefox OS platform as well, you
would use the following command:

  cva-create thing_1 com.mycorp.thingamajig Thingamajig firefoxos
